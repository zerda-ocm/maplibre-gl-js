Make color-splitting work for plain string text-fields as well as format Formatted fields. Currently we only call applyColorSplit(Formatted.factory(resolvedTokens)) for formatted outputs; change the evaluation so that when resolvedTokens is a plain string (e.g. ["get","name"]) itâ€™s converted/wrapped to a Formatted (or otherwise passed through applyColorSplit) and yields identical colored sections. Preserve existing marker rules (PUA named colors U+E001..U+E094, RGB U+E100 + #RRGGBB, RGBA U+E101 + #RRGGBBAA). Update symbol_bucket.ts (evaluateText) and reuse color_split.ts. Add unit tests for both formatted and plain-string cases.
